# Player Movement Conformance

This artifact measures player movement against the documented control principles for Aurora:

- tap should support fine correction
- hold should support meaningful lane travel
- reversal should settle quickly enough for evasive play
- firing while moving should not stall the ship or suppress the shot window

## Summary

- Baseline score: 10/10

- Delta: 0

## Current build

- Tap correction abs delta: 14.14
- Hold travel delta: 87.48
- Hold settle after release (ms): 216
- Reversal cross ms: 250
- Shot delay while moving (ms): -3
- Post-shot travel: 49.02
- Max frame step: 10.97

## Read

- This movement conformance check now uses first-pass trace-backed targets derived from the preserved stage-opening alignment window.
- Use it to catch jerkiness, sluggish release, weak lane travel, or movement-plus-fire regressions.
- Tighten the targets again once direct frame-level movement extraction is automated from the preserved Galaga gameplay footage.
