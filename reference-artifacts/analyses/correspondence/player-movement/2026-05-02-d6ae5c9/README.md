# Player Movement Conformance

This artifact measures player movement against the documented control principles for Aurora:

- tap should support fine correction
- hold should support meaningful lane travel
- reversal should settle quickly enough for evasive play
- firing while moving should not stall the ship or suppress the shot window

## Summary

- Baseline score: 10/10
- Current score: 8/10
- Delta: -2

## Current build

- Tap correction abs delta: 0
- Hold travel delta: 38.1
- Hold settle after release (ms): 200
- Reversal cross ms: 58
- Shot delay while moving (ms): 13
- Post-shot travel: 65.69
- Max frame step: 7.51

## Read

- This movement conformance check now uses first-pass trace-backed targets derived from the preserved stage-opening alignment window.
- Use it to catch jerkiness, sluggish release, weak lane travel, or movement-plus-fire regressions.
- Tighten the targets again once direct frame-level movement extraction is automated from the preserved Galaga gameplay footage.
